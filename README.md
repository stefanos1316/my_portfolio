# Regarding the repository 

Coded and developed by [Maxim Orlov](https://github.com/orlovmax).
Extended by Stefanos Georgiou.

[My portoflio](http://stefanos1316.github.io/my_portfolio/build/index.html) works with GitHub pages and it is powerd by Gulp.js and StyleSheet Langauges (Sass). 
In the portoflio you can find the following links:

* [Home page](https://stefanos1316.github.io/my_portfolio/build/home.html), a page that combines a brief discussion regarding who I am and what I like to do.
* [My Blog](https://stefanos1316.github.io/my_blog/index.html), a page that offers aritcles regarding technical documents and travelling activities.
* [Curriculum vitae](https://stefanos1316.github.io/my_curriculum_vitae/index.html), a page containig my CV.

The Blog page is composed is a similar manner with My portoflio (gulp.js and sass) and Curriculum vitae is using pandoc and latex to create html and pdf documents. 
Also, the afore-mentioned sites are using travis-ci for auto-deploy (compiled on travis VMs and push as a gh-pages branch beck to the remote repository).
